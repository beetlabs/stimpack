> Simple dependency injection for TypeScript and React

Dependency injection without the framework, and without `reflect-metadata`. Just pure TypeScript.

## Install

```bash
npm install @beetlabs/stimpack
```

## Usage

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@beetlabs/stimpack'

@Injectable()
class Dependency {
  test() {
    console.log('yay')
  }
}

const token = new Symbol();
@Injectable({
  token,
  inject: [Dependency]
})
class Service {
  constructor(
    dependency: Dependency
  ) {}

  method() {
    this.dependency.test() // typesafe
  }
}
```
In React:
```tsx
// App.tsx
import { InjectionProvider } from '@beetlabs/stimpack/react'

<InjectionProvider>
  {/* ... the rest of your app */}
</InjectionProvider>


// SomeComponent.tsx
import { useInjection } from '@beetlabs/stimpack/react'
import { SomeService } from './some-injectable-service'

export const Component = () => {
  const service = useInjection(SomeService) // typesafe!
}
```

## API

### Injectable
```ts
function Injectable(options?: {
  token?: symbol,
  inject?: any[]
})
```
This is where the magic happens. `Injectable` is a `ClassDecorator` which registers a service with the injection container. *Note that for now the `inject` array does need to match the order of the dependencies in the constructor:
```ts
@Injectable({
  inject: [Dep2, Dep1]
})
class Service {
  constructor(
    dep1: Dep1,
    dep2: Dep2
  ) {}

  test() {
    dep1.someMethodOnDep1() // this will fail because we injected Dep2 first
  }
}
```

### Container
```ts
interface Container {
  instance: Container;
  register(service: any, token?: symbol): void;
  resolve<T>(token?: any | symbol): T
}
```
Most of the time you won't need to interact directly with `Container`, but in the case that you are extending this to use with a framework, it's here for you. `Container` is a singleton with a private constructor, so access it with `instance`. The other two methods do what they sound like.

### useInjection
```ts
useInjection<T>(token: any | symbol): T 
```
Exposes `Container#resolve` to React!
